# Customer-Subscription-prediction
I analyzed the **bankmarketing.csv** dataset to predict term deposit subscriptions. Based on data cleaning, encoding, and model training (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest), I found contact, poutcome, month, and call duration as key factors. Random Forest performed best, giving insights to optimize marketing strategies.
